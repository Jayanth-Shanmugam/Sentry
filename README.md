# Sentry
Sentry is a smart security camera built using Python and OpenCV. It uses real-time face recognition to identify family members. Face detection is done using the 
Haar Cascades object detection algorithm, and face recognition through the LBPH algortihm both of which are available to implement in OpenCV.
